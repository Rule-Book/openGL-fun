# openGL-fun
repo to track tests of openGL and understanding how it works

I need openGL
I need a c or c++ compiler to use GLUT (or GLFW) library
  I need CMake or GNU Make to tailor project files to exclude noncompatible linux files
I need *source code* for GLUT, a window toolkit, to create an openGL context to work from
I need GLAD an OpenGL loading library to link/include system specific OpenGL API functions for c code to find/reference
