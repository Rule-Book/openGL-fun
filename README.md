# openGL-fun
repo to track tests of openGL and understanding how it works

First I updated my graphics driver with a manual download from NVidia for the first time in 4+ years
I need openGL
already included in windows and graphics update?
I need a c or c++ compiler to use GLFW library
https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/
I need CMake or GNU Make to tailor project files to exclude noncompatible linux files
https://cmake.org/download/
I need *source code* for GLFW, a window toolkit, to create an openGL context to work from
https://www.glfw.org/download (tried using cmake and it added bloat and no functionality?)
I need GLAD, an OpenGL loading library, to generate a header file of OpenGL API functions to include in C code
